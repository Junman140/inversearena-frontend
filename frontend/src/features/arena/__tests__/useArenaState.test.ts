/**
 * Tests for toArenaState's on-chain GameState -> UI state mapping (#1151).
 *
 * `ArenaState.state` used to collapse every on-chain GameState variant into
 * just "active" | "finished" (`data.hasWon ? "finished" : "active"`), which
 * meant a cancelled or settled arena displayed as joinable. That specific bug
 * was fixed in #1169 (see the mapState() switch below), but no test verified
 * the mapping — this file is that missing coverage, pinning the current
 * behavior of every GameState value against regression.
 *
 * The on-chain GameState enum (contract/arena/src/types.rs) is, in
 * discriminant order: Open=0, Active=1, Finished=2, Cancelled=3, Settled=4 --
 * there is no on-chain "Resolving" variant. toArenaState's switch labels
 * gameState 2 as "resolving" rather than "finished"/"settled": this is a
 * real, current mismatch between the UI label and the actual on-chain
 * state, found while writing this test and asserted below (not silently
 * papered over) so it's visible rather than accidentally locked in as
 * "correct" by a passing test that never named it.
